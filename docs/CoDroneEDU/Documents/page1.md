## CoDrone EDU User Manual

Every CoDrone EDU kit comes with a user manual that comes in handy if you need a quick reminder on how to pair, charge, or use all of the controller buttons. If you lost your manual or need a digital copy, you can view the PDF at the link below. We recommend always having the user manual with you in class or when you compete.
