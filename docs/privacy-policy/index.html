</ul><p>We retain personal information only as long as is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.</p><h3>7. Processing in the United States</h3><p>Robolink operates its business, including the Education Portals, in the United States and processes personal information in the United States. As such, when you visit the Education Portals or submit information, your personal information may be processed outside of the country or region in which you reside.</p><h3 id="Additional-Information-about-Children-Privacy">8. Additional Information about Children’s Privacy</h3><p><strong>Age Verification and Parents</strong></p><p>The section below supplements this Privacy Notice and explains how we collect information from Child Users on the Education Portals and in connection with our Services.</p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ THIS IF YOU ARE A CHILD USER OR A PARENT, TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION.</p><p>As explained in more detail below, if you are a Child User and want to create an account, you will need to provide your Parent’s email so that we can contact them. Only your Parent will be able to create an account for you.</p><h4>a. Age Verification</h4><p>All users on the Education Portals, including Parents, teachers, and Students, may view lessons, content, and documentation without creating an account (or logging in). However, users cannot track their progress when they are not logged in (note that the documentation portal does not allow or require user registration).</p><p>This is how it works:</p><ul>
<li>Users who are not Parents or teachers and who wish to register on the Education Portals as &quot;<strong>Students</strong>&quot; are asked to enter their date of birth for purposes of complying with COPPA.</li>
<li>f a user’s response indicates that the Student is a Child User, the Child User is prompted to submit a Parent’s email address so that Robolink may contact the Child User’s Parent via email with information about how to create the account.</li>
<li>Robolink does not knowingly permit Child Users to create an account without the consent of a Parent (or School).</li>
<li></li>
</ul><p>If you are a Parent and discover that your child under the age of 13 has registered without your consent, please contact us at <a href="/docs/privacy-policy">privacy@robolink.com</a> to request that we delete your Child User’s personal information from our systems.</p><h4>b. Parental Consent and Account Creation</h4><p>Parents may follow the instructions contained in an email sent by Robolink to the Parent’s email address provided by the Child User at registration.</p><p>Once a Parent of a Child User creates a Parent account, they can create a Child User student account for their Child User. For Child User student accounts, we only collect username and password and the Parent whose account it is associated with. Only the Parent account can create a username for a Child User student account. Parents can revoke a Child User’s permissions to use the Education Portals at any time by deleting the account. To do so, Parents can log into their account and delete any Child User account associated with theirs.</p><p><strong>We strongly recommend that Parents select a username that does not relate to or identify the real name of the Child User. The Child User’s username can only be changed by the Parent.</strong></p><p>If a Parent does not create an account after receiving the email and links from Robolink, Child Users can continue to access the materials on the Education Portals without registering for an account.</p><p><strong>Limited Information Collection, Use and Sharing</strong></p><h4>a. Information We Collect About Child Users</h4><p>Robolink collects username and password for the Child User account. Robolink also collects device and usage information via cookies (as explained <a href="/docs/privacy-policy#Automatically-collected-information">here</a>). This is information about the Child User’s use of the Education Portal and includes lessons completed and progress only if the Child User is logged in.</p><p>Robolink limits its collection of personal information from Child Users:</p><ul>
<li>Child Users cannot input additional information about themselves, and Child Users cannot make their information publicly available.</li>
<li>Child Users cannot receive emails from Robolink – any such emails are sent to the Child User’s Parent associated with the Child User’s account.</li>
</ul><h4>b. How We Use and Share Child User Information</h4><p>We use personal information to provide the Education Portals and our Services only, as described in section 3 (&quot;How We Use Your Information&quot;) above. We use the Parent’s email address to communicate messages about the Child User’s account. Robolink does not use Child Users’ personal information for non-educational commercial purposes (e.g., advertising).</p><p>We disclose information as set forth <a href="/docs/privacy-policy#When-We-Disclose-Your-Information">here in more detail</a>. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>To our service providers who work on our behalf and help us operate and administer the Education Portals and our Services</li>
<li>To a Parent or with a Parent’s consent</li>
<li>To Schools, if applicable (please see the section titled <a href="/docs/privacy-policy#Additional-Information-about-Schools-and-Student-Use">Additional Information about Schools and Student Use</a> for more information)</li>
<li>In connection with business transfers (e.g., mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcy sales) under certain circumstances</li>
<li>To comply with applicable laws and fulfill our own legal obligations, and when reasonably necessary to protect the security and safety of our users, Education Portals and Services, or when permitted by law.<br>

</ul><h4>c. No Third-Party Tracking for Targeted Advertising</h4><p>Robolink does not use advertising cookies or tracking technologies on the Education Portals, and specifically does not serve any targeted advertising to Child Users. We do not disclose personal information of Child Users for direct marketing purposes or for targeted advertising purposes. In addition, we have taken steps to ensure that there is no Ad Partner technology on the Education Portals.</p><h4>d. Accessing, Modifying or Deleting your Child’s Account</h4><p>As a Parent, you have the ability to access and control information about your Child User. You can log into your Parent account, and review , delete or update the information associated with your account, including a Child User’s information. Please contact <a href="/docs/privacy-policy">privacy@robolink.com</a> if you need further assistance.

Additional Information about Schools and Student Use</h3><p>This section supplements this Privacy Notice when Robolink collects personal information in connection with Schools’ use of the Services and Education Portals.</p><h4>a. School Ownership of Information</h4><p>When our Services and Education Portals are used by Schools (including school districts and teachers) as part of Schools’ educational programs, personal information about or relating to the Students may include information defined as &quot;education records&quot; by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&quot;FERPA&quot;) or similar state Student data privacy laws, depending on the School. We refer to this information as &quot;Student Personal Information&quot; throughout this section. FERPA is a federal law that prevents Schools from releasing certain information about your child to vendors such as Robolink absent certain restrictions and additional obligations.</p><p>When Schools provide Student information in connection with their use of the Services and Education Portals, we have special agreements in place with Schools that use the Services and Education Portals for educational purposes. Those agreements require us to comply with certain restrictions, including the following:</p><ul>
<li>The School controls the personal information of its Students, and Robolink will use it only according to terms of the contract and for the purpose of benefiting the School;
Robolink will assist the School in responding to requests from Parents or eligible Students to inspect and review personal information and categories of data being held, including correction;</li>
<li>Robolink will not share information obtained from the School with third parties, unless this is specifically consented to; and</li>
<li>Robolink is restricted from using the information for marketing, including behavioral advertising or targeting, or profile-building.</li>
</ul><p>Robolink may use aggregated anonymized data and de-identified metadata for internal operations purposes such as improving the functioning of the Education Portals and Services and conducting research to validate and improve the Education Portals and Services.</p><h4>b. Information Security and Breach Notification</h4><p>If Robolink becomes aware of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party or that any user data was used for an unauthorized purpose, we will comply with relevant state and other data breach laws. We will notify users of any breach resulting in unauthorized release of data electronically, at minimum, and without unreasonable delay so that you can take appropriate steps. The notification will include: date of the breach, the types of information that were subject to the breach, general description of what occurred, and steps Robolink is taking to address the breach.</p><p>We work with Schools to protect Student Personal Information in compliance with FERPA and, for School Users who are under 13, COPPA, as explained in our section titled <a href="/docs/privacy-policy#Additional-Information-about-Children-Privacy">Additional Information about Children’s Privacy</a>. If you have any questions general or about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a Student, please contact your School directly. You may also contact us at <a href="/docs/privacy-policy">privacy@robolink.com</a>.</p><h3>12.
