## What is Blockly?

Learn the foundations of coding with drag-and-drop blocks in our visual programming language. This is an excellent starting place for beginner programmers and drone pilots.

Blockly is a block coding program from Robolink based on Python. The types of blocks are divided into junior blocks and senior blocks according to the difficulty level.  

Junior blocks have these things: (CoDrone EDU blocks) Flight Commands, Flight Sequences, Status Checkers, Lights, Sounds, (Programming blocks) Events, Input/Output, Logic, Loops, Math, Timing, Variables, Lists. 

Senior blocks have these things: (CoDrone EDU blocks) Flight Commands, Flight Variables, Status Checkers, Sensors, Lights, Sounds, Screen, Colors, (Programming blocks) Events, Input/Output, Logic, Loops, Math, Timing, Variables, Functions, Lists.

## How to Access Blockly

Blockly is an online application that you can access right from Google Chrome. With Blockly, you can connect it to your drone since Blockly runs from your browser&mdash;no need for any installation!

### Link to Blockly
Start programming your drone with Blockly by heading to <a href="robolink.com/blockly-cde">robolink.com/blockly-cde</a>! After going to the provided link for Blockly, click on the CoDroneEDU icon to create the enviroment for CoDroneEDU programming.

Try to use the cable that comes with CoDrone EDU whenever possible! This Micro USB cable can transfer data, which is necessary for programming. Most Micro USB cables now are data compatible. If your drone does not switch to LINK state when connecting, you may have the wrong cable or it may be broken.

### Google Chrome Requirements

Your Google Chrome should be updated to the most recent version. If you are not sure how to check, click on the the menu on the top right, scroll down to “Help”, and select “About Google Chrome”. Google Chrome might automatically update. If not, please update Chrome.
